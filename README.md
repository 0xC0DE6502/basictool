TODO: Actually write something!

## Credits

lib6502.[ch] were originally written by Ian Piumarta. I wanted to use an actively maintained version, so those included in this project were taken from https://github.com/hoglet67/PiTubeClient.

cargs.[ch] from https://github.com/likle/cargs are used for cross-platform command-line argument parsing.
